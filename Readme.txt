• What is the project doing?
Generates a tree ring growth data structure in Json format for developing logistic regression models for tree mortality.
Using open data on the growth of tree rings (Cailleret, et al., 2016), a converter has been developed that converts two datasets Treedata.txt and RWdata.txt into one TreeRWdata.json. The R.

• How is the project useful?
The initial data is convenient to use in R. The R Project for Statistical Computing: https://www.r-project.org/
• How can users get started with a project?
The user has formed data for studying the mortality of trees that are in the public domain.
• Where can users get help with your project?
Consultation on the project on the site.
• Who supports and participates in the project?
So far, this is my personal initiative. Everyone is welcome!
